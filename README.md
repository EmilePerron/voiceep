# voiceep

Voiceep was a website that offered an audio voiceover widget and management system for bloggers and website owners.

Users could create an account and add a simple Javascript snippet to their pages, and with very few settings/configurations, they could start creating (or automatically generating) voiceovers for their website's content or blog articles.
The widget would add a simple audio player that allowed visitors to listen to a page's content instead of reading it.

The project has been shut down as of April 2020, and its entire source code is now available for reference on GitHub: https://github.com/EmilePerron/voiceep
