                <h2>The importance of audio</h2>
                <p>The most important asset we have in life is our time, so it’s easy to understand why among the few people who click on your articles, <a href="https://time.com/12933/what-you-think-you-know-about-the-web-is-wrong/" target="_blank" class="reference">more than half will spend less than 15 seconds on your page</a>. Unless your texts are incredibly short, that’s simply not going to cut it. </p>
                <p>On the other hand, the consumption of audio content is increasing by the minute, with many big companies like Apple and Amazon shifting their focus towards voice-oriented devices and services. Audio allows people to consume your content without all of the negative elements that reading on a screen brings to the table, and most importantly: it saves time.</p>
                <p>However, producing and distributing audio content usually requires a lot of time and ressources for businesses. That’s why we’re here: Voiceep makes it easy for blog owners and news sites to get into the audio game.</p>

                <h2>The rise of podcasts</h2>
                <p>It’s no secret that podcasts are popular. According to a 2018 study, <a href="https://www.journalism.org/fact-sheet/audio-and-podcasting/" target="_blank" class="reference">44% of Americans have listened to podcasts before</a>. In the US, <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ActivateInc/activate-tech-media-outlook-2018" target="_blank" class="reference">podcasting is projected to reach 112 million monthly listeners by 2021</a>.</p>
                <p>At Voiceep, we want to help you to take advantage of that incredible platform. We understand that your time is precious, which is why we do our best to simplify the podcast creation and management for you. Simply link your website with our service, and a podcast can be automatically created and distributed on your behalf. </p>
                <p>We offer many options in order to best suit your needs and budget, from automated text-to-speech using Amazon’s Polly technology to professional voice-actors reading and recording your content. If you want your texts to have a more personalized touch, you can also upload your own voiceovers, or record them online in a matter of minutes using our recording interface.</p>
